Notebooks Readme
################

(*) notebooks are the important ones, either by the results they contain or by 
the fact that they implement methods used by other programs.

03-analysis_effect_of_n
-----------------------
Analysis of the effect of the training set size and a faw other parameters (such as batch size).

bdd_analysis (*)
----------------
Notebook that loads a database generated by ``evaluation/generate_bdd.py``, where relevant information of
trained models is stored. Some analysis about the link between model performance and train data gyrification,
time efficiency or validation loss are then performed.

check_svm_consistency
---------------------
Notebook to check if svm are consistent, i.e. if they converge and how fast.
This question was risen because of the highly fluctuating results of the whole
pipeline under a certain validation loss.

count_voxels (*)
----------------
Notebook to visualize information about gyrification for datasets throuigh the number of voxels in
a normalized space. This notebooks also contains codes to generate gyrification based subsets (like
the most or least folded subsets of a dataset).

optimize_transforms
-------------------
Notebook to compare and decrease computation time of SimCLR augmentations.

paracingulate_analysis
----------------------
Localisation of paracingulate (and proeminent ones) in the latent space.

test_scaling
------------
Notebook to test which scaler to add before running the classification.
